# Variables that will be available for `layouts` patterns.
# To use: {{layouts.variable}}

#
# Inside each layout, we use letters to specify each component. The tool
# currently sorts them alphabetically when outputting the Angular-driven
# prototype, so this ensures that they show up in the intended order
#
# @see https://github.com/north/Style-Prototypes/issues/6
